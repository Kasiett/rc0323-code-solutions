- `Array.forEach`:

  - What does `Array.forEach` do?
    It allows you to loop through an array and execute a callback function on each element of the array
  - What should the callback function do?
    The purpose of the callback function is to perform some operation on each element, such as displaying it on the screen or modifying it in some way.
  - What is `Array.forEach` useful for?
    forEach is useful for performing operations on each element of an array, such as updating a user interface or performing calculations

- `Array.map`:

  - What does `Array.map` do?
    It allows you to create a new array based on an existing array by applying a callback function to each element in the array.
  - What should the callback function return?
    The purpose of the callback function is to transform each element of the original array into a new element in the new array.
  - What is `Array.map` useful for?
    .map is useful for creating a new array based on an existing array, such as transforming data or formatting values. It is particularly useful when you need to manipulate an array and return a new array with the same number of elements.

- `Array.filter`:

  - What does `Array.filter` do?
    It allows you to create a new array by filtering out elements from an existing array based on a condition defined by a callback function.
  - What should the callback function return?
    The purpose of the callback function is to test each element of the original array against a condition and return a boolean value indicating whether the element should be included in the new array.

  - What is `Array.filter` useful for?
    .filter is useful for creating a new array that contains only the elements of an existing array that meet a certain condition. It is particularly useful when you need to filter data based on a specific criterion, such as selecting elements that satisfy a certain range of values or that match a particular pattern.
