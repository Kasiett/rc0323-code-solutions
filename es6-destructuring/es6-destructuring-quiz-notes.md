  Destructuring allows to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables, which can then be used in code
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  declare a constant and open curly braces inside the braces, list the properties you want to extract from the object. These properties are separated by commas, close curly braces and assign it to obj variable.

  const { property1, property2 } = object;

  Declare constant open square brackets list variables which will represent indexes of array close square brackets and asighn it to array variable.
