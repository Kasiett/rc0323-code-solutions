## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is JSX?
  JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension syntax used in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, combining HTML structure and JavaScript logic in a single file. JSX is not a requirement for using React, but it is commonly used because it provides a concise and expressive way to describe the structure and behavior of components.

JSX is transpiled to regular JavaScript code by tools like Babel before it can be executed in a web browser. This conversion process allows React to understand and render JSX code into the desired HTML structure.

- How does React use JSX to render components?
  React uses JSX to define the structure and composition of components. JSX is transpiled to regular JavaScript code by tools like Babel, which converts it into function calls that create and manipulate React elements.
