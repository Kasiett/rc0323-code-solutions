After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the JavaScript Event Loop?
  The JavaScript Event Loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous events in a non-blocking way.
  event loop continuously checks if there are any pending events in the event queue, if there is something in queue and nothing inside callstach it trigers and calls first thing inside the queue
- What is different between "blocking" and "non-blocking" with respect to how code is executed?
  the main difference between blocking and non-blocking code execution is how the program handles waiting for a task to complete. In blocking code, the program waits for the task to complete before moving on, while in non-blocking code, the program continues executing other tasks while waiting for the task to complete in the background.
